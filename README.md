# Sets

Implement the immutable class intSet using an array to represent a set of integers in the range 1-1000. It should support public methods like - 

isMember(int x) - check whether x is a member of the set and return a boolean value

size() - return the size of the set

isSubSet(intSet s) - check whether s is a subset of the set

getComplement()  - return the complement set, you can assume that 1..1000 is the universal set

union(intSet s1, intSet s2) - return the union of s1 and s2

You may use private helper methods.
